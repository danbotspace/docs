# Proxying

Proxying might sound a hard job to do but actually it's not! In this page I used cloudflare to proxy my domain!

## Available DBH domains

- \*.never-gonna-give-you-up.xyz
- \*.never-gonna-let-you-down.xyz
- \*.never-gonna-make-you-cry.xyz
- \*.never-gonna-run-around-and-desert-you.xyz
- \*.never-gonna-say-goodbye.xyz
- \*.never-gonna-tell-a-lie-and-hurt-you.xyz
- \*.rick-roll.xyz

<Tip label="Good to know">
  By becoming a donator you get an access to *.only-fans.club!

## Set DNS record

In order to proxy your domain to one of your servers you have to set a DNS record!

![Add a record](/content/proxying/add-record.png)

There after clicking "Add record" you have to fill all fields as in the image:

![Fill given fields](/content/proxying/proxy-fields.png)

Consider adding this IP: <Copy value="69.30.249.53".

<Tip>If you're using cloudflare consider turning off "Proxy Status".</Tip>

After everything is done click "Save" and head to discord!

## Proxy using a command

As always you should use given in [Getting Started](/getting-started) channels. Do `DBH!server proxy <domain> <server id>` in order to proxy your domain to your server. Make sure "domain" field doesn't have neither "http://" nor "https://" in it!

After it is done you have to wait up to 1-2 minutes to see the result. Bot will ping you if it is proxied!

<Tip>
  If you faced a problem and bot didn't give you a success result please
  consider contacting moderation in order to fix your issue. Also make sure
  everything is fine in your proxy fields!
